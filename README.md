## Pikachu

Pikachu is a Python program that uses the turtle graphics library to draw a detailed cartoon of Pikachu. The main logic is implemented in the `Pikachu.py` file, where a series of custom drawing functions create and assemble Pikachu's facial features, ears, cheeks, and accessories such as a cap, resulting in an interactive and visually appealing cartoon rendering.

### Features

- Draws a cartoon Pikachu using Python's turtle graphics.
- Modular code structure with functions for drawing individual facial features and accessories.
- Interactive drawing: parts of the cartoon can respond to mouse drags.
- Educational: demonstrates geometric drawing and animation with turtle graphics.

### How It Works

- The main class, `Cartoon`, contains methods for drawing each part of Pikachu (eyes, cheeks, mouth, ears, etc.).
- The `main()` function sets up the turtle screen and starts the drawing process.
- Run the script to see Pikachu come to life on your screen.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The `turtle` module (comes standard with most Python installations)

### Usage

```bash
python Pikachu.py
```

This will open a window and begin drawing the Pikachu cartoon automatically.

Feel free to modify and enhance the cartoon, or use the code as a reference for your own turtle graphics projects!
